Project Nmae:- Push-Up and Pull-up Detection with repetition count

Libraries Used:- cv2, numpy, mediapipe and PoseModule
To Install these Libraries run the following code in terminal. (pip install cv2 numpy mediapipe PoseModule)

Activate mediapipeâ€™s Pose Detection module.
Detect the human body.
Finds the position of the different landmarks on the human body based on the model.
Finds the angle between joints (depending on which joints you select).
For my program, I chose to find the angle at the elbow, shoulder, and hip as those are vital for proper push-up or pull-up form.
I chose to find the angle at the wrist to differentiate between a pull-up or a push-up.
